# Web Font Preloading

`Boilerplate` comes with a simple, modern and lightweight font loader. [Nuxt Font Loader](https://github.com/ivodolenc/nuxt-font-loader) is super-easy to use without complicated settings and additional code bloat.

Font Loader supports all types of font loading 🔥 (local, Google, Typekit, custom, etc.) and follows the best practice for `modern`, `fast` and `efficient` font loading. Also, module includes settings for resource hints `prefetch`, `preconnect` and `preload`.

Module is enabled by default.

See `nuxt/modules/fontLoader.js`

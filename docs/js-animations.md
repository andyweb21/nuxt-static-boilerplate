# JavaScript Animations

## Nuxt Anime.js

`Boilerplate` provides a lightweight and powerful solution for JS animations. [Nuxt Anime.js](https://github.com/ivodolenc/nuxt-animejs) is available globally and allows you to easily animate elements via custom `v-anime` directive.

### Module

`nuxt-animejs` is enabled by default.

### Scroll-Based Animations

Anime.js can be used with the ScrollMagic library to get some super-cool animations based on scroll position. Also, the combination of these two libraries is **less than 20kb**. üî•
